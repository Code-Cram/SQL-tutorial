# SQL Tutorial

As a Data Science student, I created this SQL tutorial to help anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals of SQL. This tutorial is based on my own classes and the FreeCodeCamp SQL tutorial on YouTube. It includes explanations, examples, and queries to help you understand how SQL works. Enjoy the knowledge

This tutorial was created by me (Marc Martínez Arias), but the resources and workflow are based on GirrafeAcademy. The SQL tutorial video can be found here: [FreeCodeCamp SQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=13095s). Additionally, I added extra resources from my classes, including summaries of the content.  

**IMPORTANT:** This tutorial is free, so there might be mistakes. If anyone wants to correct them, I’m totally open to it. It’s also important to follow along with the YouTube tutorial. Both parts can be implemented in either MySQL or PostgreSQL.  

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial has two main parts:

### 1. Fundamentals

- `SQL_concepts`: Contains two files explaining key SQL concepts.  
- `Example_queries`: Contains SQL files that support the explanations.  
- Both folders have files numbered in order to follow the learning sequence.  

### 2. Real Example

- `database_company`: A full example of building a company database.  
  - Includes a PNG file to visualize the database structure.  
  - Contains SQL files following the same numbered format as the previous folders, with queries to support the explanations.  
  - Also includes a `csv` folder. The purpose of this folder is to allow users to import the data into other tools or languages, or to export it if needed.
